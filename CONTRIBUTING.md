Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing to EasyBlog! We appreciate your 
effort, but to make sure that the inclusion of your patch is a smooth process, we
ask that you make note of the following guidelines.

* **Keep your code clean and readable.**
  We can't stress this enough; if your code has notable issues, it may delay
  the process significantly.
* **Try to stick to HTML5 standards.** While this step isn't overly important, please try to make sure your code [validates](http://validator.w3.org).
* **Make sure your code is efficient.** One way you can achieve this is to spend
  around five minutes to think about what the code is doing and whether it
  seems awfully roundabout. If you had to copy the same large piece of
  code in several places, that's bad.
* **Keep commit summaries under 70 characters.** For more details, place two
  new lines after the summary line and write away!
* **Test your code.** We're not interested in broken code, for the obvious reasons.
* **Make sure everything is right before you send a pull request.** This helps us keep the process fairly fast and helps filter out issues. 

Checklist
---------

Ready to submit? Perform the checklist below:

1. Have you checked over your code to see if it complies with what's written above?
2. Have I combined my commits into a reasonably small number (if not one)
   commit?
3. Have I made my pull request too large? Pull requests should introduce
   small sets of changes at a time. Major changes should be broken down into smaller commits, so it's easier to track if an issue occurs.
4. Are my commit messages descriptive?
